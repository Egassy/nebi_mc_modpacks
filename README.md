# Modpacks by Nebula

This repository holds all the necessary files to run self-updating Minecraft modpacks that I have put together for my friends.

Packwiz stores the manifest of mods and other files needed, and unsup (a java agent) is pointed to the pack.toml file of the relevant modpack hosted here for automatic updates upon launch of the pack no need to manually update.

Also stored here are the aforementioned extra files, such as a copy of the Vanilla Tweaks resource pack that I have pre-customized, or pre-selected option files for Redstone Tweaks. Unsup reaches into this repo (or Modrinth or CurseForge) to grab the files it needs as they are needed.
